Tier (High/Very High Severity),Group1,Definition,Estimated Number in Group,Rationale
1,Deployed and mission critical personnel for national security,"Military forces and other mission critical personnel not limited to active duty military or U.S. government employees.  Includes some diplomatic and intelligence service personnel, and public and private sector functions identified by federal agencies as unique and critical to national security","850,000","Critical to protect national security, unable to tolerate projected pandemic personnel loss and fulfill mission, potential greater risk of infection due to geographic location and crowded living or working conditions."
1,Public health personnel,"Public health responders at federal, state and local levels","300,000","Essential to implementing the pandemic response, including the vaccination program and other pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical response measures; also provide care for low income and underserved populations; personnel at increased risk of exposure to persons with pandemic illness, and also increased work load to respond to the pandemic."
1,Inpatient healthcare providers,Includes two-thirds of personnel at acute care hospitals who would be identified by their institution as critical to provision of inpatient health care services; primarily will include persons providing care with direct patient exposure but also will include persons essential to maintaining hospital infrastructure.,"3,200,000","Maintaining quality inpatient health care is critical to reducing mortality from pandemic influenza and from other illnesses that will occur concurrently with the pandemic; inpatient healthcare burden will likely be markedly increased during a pandemic; studies show health outcomes are associated with staff-to-patient ratio; personnel have increased risk of exposure, including to infectious aerosols; infected healthcare personnel may transmit infection to vulnerable persons hospitalized for non-influenza illnesses."
1,Outpatient and home health providers,"Includes two-thirds of personnel identified by their organization at outpatient facilities, including but not limited to physicians’ offices, primary care clinics, dialysis centers, urgent care centers, retail health clinics, and blood donation facilities; and skilled home health care personnel providing care with direct patient exposure.","2,600,000","Maintaining outpatient and home health care is critical to reducing pandemic mortality and morbidity and reducing the burden on inpatient services; outpatient healthcare burden will be markedly increased during a pandemic; personnel have increased risk of exposure, possibly including to infectious aerosols; infected health care personnel may transmit infection to vulnerable persons receiving care for non-influenza illness."
1,Health care providers in long term care facilities (LTCFs),Includes two-thirds of personnel at LTCFs identified by their organization as critical to the provision of care.,"1,600,000","Essential to provide care to more than 3 million persons in LTCFs who are particularly vulnerable to influenza illness and death; risk of pandemic outbreaks in LTCFs may best be reduced by vaccinating staff and limiting exposure of residents to infection; if outbreaks occur, personnel have increased risk of exposure, possibly including to infectious aerosols, and can spread pandemic influenza to their high-risk patients."
1,Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians,Includes pharmacists dispensing drugs at retail locations and pharmacy technicians who interact with the public and are essential for pharmacy operations (note that pharmacists in hospitals or outpatient centers may be targeted as part of those groups).,"725,000",Essential to dispense medications and administer vaccinations for pandemic influenza and other illnesses; demand for pharmacist services would be expected to increase during a pandemic.

1,Manufacturers of pandemic vaccine and antiviral drugs,Includes critical personnel required for ongoing production of pandemic medical countermeasures to support a pandemic response.,"50,000",Reducing pandemic health impacts requires production of pandemic vaccine and anti-influenza drugs.
1,Pregnant women,Women at any stage of pregnancy,"4,000,000","Pregnant women are at high risk of severe complications or death from pandemic influenza due to immunological, circulatory, and respiratory changes that occur during pregnancy; vaccinating pregnant women also reduces the risk of influenza in infants up to 6 months of age."
1,Infants and toddlers (6-35 months old),Infants and toddlers in the specified age group,"11,000,000",Persons in this age group are at high risk of severe complications or death from pandemic influenza; vaccination may require a lower dose than used to protect older children and adults; public values prioritize children highest among groups defined by age and disease status.
2,Essential military support and sustainment personnel,Military and other essential personnel needed to support and sustain deployed forces,"650,000",Maintaining function is essential to mission success for deployed personnel; risk of infection may be less based on geographical location and living conditions.
2,Intelligence services,Critical personnel in the intelligence community serving at domestic and international posts that are not included in tier 1,"150,000",Essential to homeland and national security; opportunities for social distancing limited because of inability to telework due to need for secure facilities; some personnel may be at increased risk based on geographical location.
2,National Guard personnel,"National Guard Personnel not included in tier 1, but who are likely to be activated to maintain public order during a pandemic or to support pandemic response services or critical infrastructure","500,000",Likely to be activated in a pandemic to support critical response or community functions; may be at increased risk of exposure and infection based on mission

2,Mortuary services personnel,Includes funeral directors,"50,000",Increased burden likely during a pandemic; may have increased occupational exposure to ill family members of deceased persons.
2,"Communications,  information technology (IT), electricity, nuclear, oil & gas, and water sector personnel, financial clearing and settlement personnel","Personnel who are critical to support essential communications, information technology, utility, financial and other services provided by the defined sectors","2,200,000","These sectors provide products and services that generally cannot be stored, are required for community health and safety, and are essential to the functioning of other critical infrastructure sectors."

2,Household contacts of infants under 6 months old.,Household contacts of infants under 6 months old,"4,500,000","Infants under 6 months old cannot be directly protected by vaccination, and influenza antiviral drugs are not approved for infants < 2 weeks old; therefore, vaccinating contacts can protect infants. Public values prioritize protection of children highest among groups at increased age risk of influenza-related complications based on age or disease status."
2,Children 3 – 18 years old with a high risk medical condition,"Children in the specified age group with a chronic medical condition that increases their risk of severe influenza disease, including heart and lung disease, metabolic disease, renal disease and neuromuscular diseases that may compromise respiratory function, as defined by ACIP recommendations for seasonal influenza vaccination.","7,000,000",Children with these conditions are at increased risk of severe complications or death from influenza disease; public values prioritize children highest among groups defined by age and disease status.
3,Remaining active duty military and essential support,Active duty personnel not included in higher priority groups and essential support personnel,"1,500,000",Essential to national and homeland security
3,Other health care personnel,"Includes groups that provide important health care services but are at less occupational risk, such as laboratory personnel","350,000",Personnel provide important health care services but are not as likely to have close contact with ill persons and are therefore at less risk of occupational infection compared to other healthcare sectors.
